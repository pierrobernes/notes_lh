## Concepts

SAFe : Scaled Agile framework
ART : Agile Release train
WSJF : Weighted Shorted Job First
* [Documentation](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/weighted-shortest-job-first/)
* Prioritization model used to sequence jobs to produce maximum economic benefit
* A team calculates each initiative’s score as the cost of delay divided by the job’s size or duration. The team then prioritizes those items that receive the highest ratings.

## Release train

Agile team powers the train

### Concept

Control the value added at each station
Align team to company business

Organization is a value stream that delivers value to the endusers (quicker & more efficiently)

### 10 steps

Train SPCs (SAFe program consultants) - change agents

* Lead the transformation by teaching the leaders on how to drive the release train
* Act as coaches 
* Connect the Agile framework to the organization entreprise

Train the Lean Agile leaders

* Lean Agile leaders need to understand the principles of the SAFe entreprise framework
* Lead & facilitate Safe implementation

Identify the value stream

* Release Train = virtual organization organized around value streams
    * Facilitate the flow of value accross the organization
* Select the most valuable workstreams with top management and senior stakeholders
* Selection by "weighted shortest job first " WSJF = Cost of delay / Job duration

Set up ART (Agile release train) with its Teams

Identifiy the teams that will deliver the value; e.g : define, build & test components
    * Each team as the full set of skills & responsibilities to release value every iteration
The agile teams power the release train.

Define roles

Critical roles to drive the ART
* Release train engineer
* System Architect
* Product Manager
* Scrum masters
* Product Owners 
* Customers

Refine the product backlog

Define the list of features to break down in US

7. Train the teams

Train the teams on SAFe
* Product owner
* Scrum Master
* ...

8. PI Planning

Common alignment between the Teams
All team members in the ART meet face 2 face for 2 days planning session
* Plan work
* Plan and commit to PI objectives
* Identify dependencies and risks (well highlighted to the board)

9. Exectue PI planning

Identify PI events: planning, system demos, 
Set common cadence: each team start and stop the iterations at the same time

10. IP iteration

Last iteration withihn the PR
    * Complete any outstanding work
    * Refine backlog for upcoming PI planning
    * Time for iteration

## Release Train engineer

SAFE framework
* Program increment : TB 
    * 

SPICE
* Support, guide and maintain train
* Preparation for correct event ocurence
* Impediments solving 
* Communication
* engineering



## PI Planning

2 days event every 8-12 weeks
* Create alignemnet
* Self organization
* Everyone in One room
* Have converstation with SH & PO

Program managers showthe features and vision

Agile Teams own story planning / estimates

Architects and engineering walk the rooms to ensure plan work properly fro

Agenda example : 

1. Kick-off by RTE (why we are here ? what changes)
2. Product managers share vision and how business solution address customer needs & gaps
3. Architecture vision - share the technical changes, improvements
4. RTE shares on planning & process to follow
    * 1 sheet for features
    * 1 sheet for risks & dependencies
5.
