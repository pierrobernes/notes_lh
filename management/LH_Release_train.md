# LH Release Train

## Wordings

Agile release train
* Concept of the Scaled Agile Framework

Principles

* Fixed schedule - flexible cargo : new system increment after a cycle
* Known velocity - capacity of each team well known (accurate estimates)
* Synchronicity between all teams (embark & finish togehter)
* Clear mid-term (at least) vision on developments to do


## Interpretations

### 1. ART as per SAFe

Train is loaded with value.  It as a terminus known in advance and delivers in different stations on its way (or on demand)

All company is driven by value delivery and agility and thus is part of the release train.

* Program increment (PI) are defined for 4 sprints with a fifth one dedicated to innovation and planning recovery.
* 2 PI at least are defined in advance
* Value delivery is prioritized which means value is assessed (expected income, cost of delay, ...) and compared to effort.  Highest value item with minimum effort is produced first
    * Cost of delay : score based on user-business value, time-criticallity, risk & opportunity

PI Planning is used to align all parties on 12 weeks
* Mandates product milestones
* Time boxed event
* 1 to 2 days - everyone participates
    * Vision is shared for the value stream
    * Stories shared and estimated
* Un-preparation means failure
* This session establishes the Squad sizing

Importance :
* Vision - need a mid and long term vision, once an PI is started, it cannot stop
* Value and value only
* Fixed size team kill act as break on the train

With the train image : 
* Engineer makes sure the train has the right speed & organizes controls on fret
    * 
* Journey must be planned : final destination (roadmap milestones) and intermediate stations
* Adapt along the way : 

### 2. Release train for code delivery

Restricted scope of ART, limited to development & delivery capabilities

Main Principles applied
* Fixed schedule - flexible cargo : obligation to release every two weeks, constant flow of value
* Synchronicity between teams : focus on enduser features in each increment

Materialization 
* Squad organization for cross-functionnal agile teams
* Synchronization events

How to embark features on the train

Gateway principle to "load" the train : 

* Product Development board : monthly
    * Validates the Epics 2 sprints in advance in terms of maturity and customer value
    * Share updates on roadmap
    * Allocate budget
    * Review Mid-term development planning including Product features & Architecture 
        * Trade-offs : technical & functional stories
        * Anticipate workload 

    PM + COO + CTO

* Architecture board : monthly
    * Review and prioritize the technical upgrades
    * Propose Technical R&D matters    
    * Address recurrent problems in the development and propose solutions
    * Impact capacity

    CTO + Tech Lead + CISO

Squad external meeting 

* Tribe board - every 2 weeks
    * Prepare next sprints  
        * Allocate subjects to squad backlog    
        * Identify dependencies between products developments
        * Squad capacity adjustments based on Product Development Board planning
    * Adjust trajectory
        * Re-allocate subjects
        * Miigate short term risks
    * Identifiy long-term risks 

    (CTO) + Tech Lead + AC + PM

* Scrum of scrum : bi-weekly
    * Raise impediments and follow their resolution
    * Assess progresses and preparation of next iterations
    * Assess maturity & quality of stories 

    SM

Squad internal meeting 

* Depending on internal organization of Squads

Gateway principle to "unload" the train : 

* QA assessment of stories at sprint startup in terms of acceptance criteria
* QA approval on increment


## Implementation 

### SAFE ART

Company transformation

Train the change agent - Future RTE
Train the top management to SAFE concepts

Transformation plan to establish & to agree
* Defines the next step
